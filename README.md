### The Google Data Analytics Professional Certification Capstone Project

## Background
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that specializes in the manufacture of health-focused smart products, specifically, devices for women. The company was founded in 2013 by Urska Srsen and Sando Mur and since the induction of the company, the company has seen steady growth. The devices specialize in collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health which infroms women of their current health trends. By the year 2016, Bellabeat had launched a variety of products and had opened up offices around the world. The company had invested significant capital into their marketing budget and had been using advertisements across a broad range of mediums.

Now, with significant growth of the company already happening, Srsen would like to leverage available smart device data from different companies to reveal more opportunities for growth. She has tasked the marketing team with the analysis of smart device usage data to gain better insights into how people tend to use their smart devices. The insights gained from this analysis will be applied to a specific Bellabeat product and will be utilized to guide marketing strategy in the future.
