# How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play it Smart?
### The Google Data Analytics Professional Certification Capstone Project

## Background
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that specializes in the manufacture of health-focused smart products, specifically, devices for women. The company was founded in 2013 by Urska Srsen and Sando Mur and since the induction of the company, the company has seen steady growth. The devices specialize in collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health which infroms women of their current health trends. By the year 2016, Bellabeat had launched a variety of products and had opened up offices around the world. The company had invested significant capital into their marketing budget and had been using advertisements across a broad range of mediums.

Now, with significant growth of the company already happening, Srsen would like to leverage available smart device data from different companies to reveal more opportunities for growth. She has tasked the marketing team with the analysis of smart device usage data to gain better insights into how people tend to use their smart devices. The insights gained from this analysis will be applied to a specific Bellabeat product and will be utilized to guide marketing strategy in the future.

## Prepare
### Data Source
The data source used in this case study was a publicly available data set available on Kaggle titled __FitBit Fitness Tracker Data__. The data contained in this dataset was that of 30 eligible and consenting FitBit users that responded to a survey distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk between the dates of March 12, 2016 and May 12, 2016. Each of the participants consented to the submission of their personal fitness tracking data which included physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring data. The data set contains 30 CSV files and was last updated three months ago.

#### Limitations
* The biggest limitation of this data is that it is from 2016, making it more than five years old and outside of the accepted "current" range. It is important to note this limitation when providing recommendations.
* A second limitation of this data is the relatively small sample size. Although 30 is typically the minimum allowable sample size for statistical testing to result in meaningful results, a bigger sample size can always be relied on for more trustworthy results.
* For the information on user weight, only 11 individuals appear to have entered information regarding weight between March 12th and April 11th and only eight users appear to have entered information regarding weight between April 12th and May 12th. Of these 11 (8) users, most of the weight information was entered manually and thus bias and human error must be considered in this case.
